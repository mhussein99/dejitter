A software toolset to characterize and reduce digital video jitter

Jitter is caused by timing disturbances in the playback of video, such as from a VCR.  This project aims to measure, model, and finally remove this form of jitter.
Jitter shows as jagged lines when played back on a VCR.  Jitter is approximately up to 6 pixels from a VCR.
